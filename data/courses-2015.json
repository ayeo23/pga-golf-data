Baldock and Jack Nevillein 1959 after the members purchased the club from Del Monte Properties. \n<p>\nIn 2003, more than 40 years later, the members decided to hire Mike Strantz to redesign a layout on par with the stunning land it was first sowed. \"I wanted to shape the course to sweep with the natural terrain-the rocks, the trees and grasses, the ocean,\" Strantz said. \"I dreamed that the course would appear to dance among the cypress trees on this coastline forever.\" Strantz designed 12 new holes and remodeled the other six to add more than 500 yards to the par-72 layout. Strantz was diagnosed with tongue cancer at the start of this final project of his life, but it is obvious that he poured everything he had left into it. He died in 2005. \n<p>\nThe Shores Course was part of the Crosby golf tournament hosted by Bing Crosby, currently the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, from 1965, 1966 and 1977. 2010 is a rebirth for the Shores Course as it has Poppy Hills Golf Course in the rotation of courses to be played by PGA TOUR pros and Hollywood celebrities.\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><A

groomed as an amenity for the guests of Waikiki's Royal Hawaiian Hotel. </P>\n<P>On land acquired from the Isenberg family, the Waialae Golf Course, as designed by San Francisco architect Seth Raynor, was opened in 1927. </P>\n<P>The 40-year-old Isenberg home became the first clubhouse for the golf course. </P>\n<P>Competitive tournament play began immediately also when the first Hawaiian Open was held there in 1928. </P>\n<P>Waialae subsequently over seven decades has hosted major golfing events and since 1965 has been the prime and only venue for the annual official Hawaiian PGA TOUR tournament. </P>\n<P>The new 18-hole, over 7,000 yards long Waialae Golf Course displayed a new look in 1999 as PGA TOUR-designated enhancements were put in place for the PGA TOUR official event, the Sony Open in Hawaii. </P>\n<P>National and international TV highlight the Hawaiian look of Waialae's tailored greens, lush fairways, signature mountain range and azure ocean as the PGA TOUR golf pros bring to life the shots arm-chair viewers and spectators dream of. </P>\n<P>The course has one adjustment to show Waialae's attributes to the very best -- the front and back nines are reversed for Tournament play in order to utilize the sun's power setting in the west. </P>\n<P><STRONG>Waialae history</STRONG></P>\n<P>Waialae overall possesses a tradition exceeding its golf historical significance. </P>\n<P>In the process of Hawaii's unification under the Hawaiian Ali'i nearly 200 years ago, beaches from Waialae to Waikiki were landing areas for the Big Island of Hawaii King Kamehameha's flotilla of canoes carrying his warriors who already had brought Maui, Lanai and Molokai under his control. </P>\n<P>As the battle raged from Waialae to Waikiki, the invaders pushed the forces of the island of O'ahu under the King, Kalanikupule, across the island, up Nuuanu Valley and to eventual victory at the Pali Lookout. </P>\n<P>What started at Waialae ended with Kamehameha as the ruler of all the islands and all of Oahu, including Waialae. </P>\n<P>The Warrior King, Kamehameha the Great, was responsible for unifying all of the islands under one ruler for the first time. </P>\n<P>Today, Waialae, steeped in tradition, retains its gracious uniqueness as the Crown Jewel of golf courses reigning over the multitude of leisure-oriented golfing facilities throughout the 50th State of Hawaii.</P>\n<P>Hole descriptions courtesy of Waialae Country Club.</P>\n<P> \n<A href=\"http://www.sonyopeninhawaii.com/course.html\" target=\"_blank\">See 2014 Course Map</a> (link opens

Shortly after, the course established itself as one of the top golf courses on the West Coast; where it became a regular stop for PGA TOUR events up until the end of the decade, when budgetary cuts caused the course to fall into poor conditions. The course further deteriorated, reaching its lowest point in 1998, when it was used as a parking lot during the U.S. Open at Olympic Club.</P>\n<P>At the turn of the century was thus born the roller coaster known as the renovation of Harding Park. In an effort to restore Harding Park to its former glory, Frank \"Sandy\" Tatum, a respective lawyer, accomplished golfer, and former USGA President, rallied together local businesses and political leaders, the USGA, the San Francisco Recreation and Park, and the PGA TOUR's Tim Finchem. Tatum played his game right, thoughtfully utilizing his resources and strategically holding a tournament there to quickly pump some serious cash into the local economy. Finchem enjoyed the idea of re-establishing a presence in the Bay Area market, and also entertained the idea of playing high-profile tournament at a truly public course. Negotiation ensued to gain approval from Mayor Willie Brown, allowing Arnold Palmer Golf Management to renovate and operate the park. Further disputes opposed, in fear that Palmer's involvement would represent privatization of a municipally-owned golf course, later causing Palmer to back out.</P>\n<P>Finally, convincing the board that the renovations would generate revenue for the city by attracting the PGA TOUR to host professional golf events, Proposition 12-passing in 2000 to fund parks across California-would alleviate debates over funding.</P>\n<P>Combined efforts resulted in a $16 million restoration in 2002-2003 featuring a complete re-design to the course. The result was a highly acclaimed championship course that maintains the character and integrity of the original layout, but incorporates design elements and infrastructure to accommodate today's players. The 15-month project to expand the course from 6,743 yards to nearly 7,200 yards in length, enhancing the driving range, clubhouse and restaurant, upgrading the nine-hole layout of Fleming, and later establishing the First Tee of San Francisco in 2004, a unique youth development program that uses golf to teach students life skills and values. Harding Park Golf Course officially reopened August 22, 2003. Since its recent renovations, TPC Harding Park is championship-worthy once again, hosting several PGA TOUR events such as, the WGC-American Express Championship, the President's Cup, and the Charles Schwab Cup Championship in 2010, 2011, and 2013. And is now on the docket to host the 2015 WGC-Match Play, 2020 PGA Championship, and 2025 President's Cup. The PGA Championship in 2020 will be the first major hosted at a TPC property. </P>\n<P>Through it all, Harding Park culminated its remarkable rebound by recently being added to the PGA TOUR's prestigious TPC Network of clubs in November of 2010. TPC Harding Park became the 32nd club in the TPC Network of courses. Entering a partnership between the PGA TOUR and the City of San Francisco, TPC Harding Park is operating under no management fees; thus, allowing both the city and the TOUR to give back to local communities through charitable donations.</P>\n<P>For more information about TPC Harding Park <A href=\"http://www.tpc.com/tpc-harding-park\" target=_blank>CLICK HERE</A></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><BR>&nbsp;</P>", "image": "/tournaments/r470/images/201409021734589258716SVRN9NKTBD.jpg", "holes": [{"number": "1", "parValue": "5", "yards": "562", "body": "A gentle dogleg left opens the day and provides a definite birdie/eagle opportunity.
